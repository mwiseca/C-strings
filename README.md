# C-strings
Use this to make simple programs related to strings.<br>
The program comments out almost anything that's not usable in a program.<br>
This is for learning and checking syntax, not enhancing productivity.

## To Use
To use the Python file, Python must be installed. The C file must be compiled
before use.
To use select an option from choices. If b is selected and Hello world. is typed,
printf("Hello world.\n"); will be displayed on the screen.
The result can be used to check syntax or pasted into a program.
To use fgets and if, else if statements   **#include <string.h>**   must be used.
To use    **__fpurge(stdin);**  to flush input buffer  **#include <stdio_ext.h>**    must be used.
Select m to go to main and select another choice or exit.<br>
