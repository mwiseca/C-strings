# C-strings
Make strings with printf.
Use this to make simple programs related to strings.
The python file can hide user input when used in the terminal on strings only.
The program comments out almost anything that's not usable in a program.
The program  makes fgets with removal of new line character
and makes if and else if statements and variables for strings.
This is for learning and checking syntax, not enhancing productivity.

**To Use:** The C++ files must be compiled
before use.
To use select an option from choices. If b is selected and Hello world. is typed,
printf("Hello world.\n"); will be displayed on the screen.
The result can be used to check syntax or pasted into a program.
To use fgets and if, else if statements   **#include <string.h>**   must be used.
To use    **__fpurge(stdin);**  to flush input buffer  **#include <stdio_ext.h>**    must be used.
Select m to go to main and select another choice or exit.
